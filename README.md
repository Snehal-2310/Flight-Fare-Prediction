## Web Application
Frontend is created using HTML and CSS and backend developed using Flask in Python and the app is deployed using Heruku.

An input form was created using a simple HTML template and a CSS style sheet. CSS describes an efficient method to keep your application's layout under control. Background colour, font size and colour, margins, positon of elements and other variables are all included in style sheets.

The Flask framework is used to create the back-end of a web application. It employs Jinja2, a templating language for creating HTML, XML, and other markup forms that are returned to the user via an HTTP request.
